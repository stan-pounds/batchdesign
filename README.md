Design an Experiment with Batches and Treatments

This R code file defines and launches a shinyR application to assist with the design of laboratory experiments 
to compare different treatments (factor of primary scientific interest) but require data to be obtained in
batches that are processed at different times (a technical nuisance factor).  It generates a table to
randomly assign samples (or subjects) to treatments and batches.

To run the app, type source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stan-pounds/batchdesign/master/batch-design-app-2019-12-02.R") in R.
